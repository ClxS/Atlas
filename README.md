# About

Atlas is my personal game engine used to create some of my private projects, as well as to act as a general playground where I can experiment with new things.
The editor portion of the project, Foundry, is unfortunately closed source for the moment.

# Roadmap

- Foundry (Closed Source) Integration
- ECS Physics + BVH
- Low level networking layer
- High-level networking layer with tagged ECS component replication
